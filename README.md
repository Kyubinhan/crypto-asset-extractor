####Kyubin Han's submission

App can be accessed [here](https://crypto-asset-extractor-7pldkspaa-kyubinhan.vercel.app/).

Notes:

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
- The project started with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) but then moved to Next.js because of CoinMarketCap API's CORS policy
- The app is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Dependencies: axios, react-query, zustand, and more

To run the development server:

1. `cd` into `crypto-asset-extractor` directory
2. Add your CoinMarketCap api key to `.env.local`
3. Install dependencies by running `yarn`
4. Run `yarn run dev` to start the dev server
